# Squishy as always 
The SquishySort algorithm is my personal sorting approach that efficiently handles large datasets by dividing the data into smaller chunks and sorting them concurrently. These smaller sections are sorted by individual threads, akin to helpers working simultaneously on different parts of the data. After sorting each chunk, the algorithm merges the sorted sections back into a single, ordered list using an efficient merge process. The depth of recursion and workload distribution is controlled by the available number of threads, ensuring balanced performance. This parallel approach significantly reduces sorting time by utilizing modern multicore processors, making it ideal for large-scale data sorting.
